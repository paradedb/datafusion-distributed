//! DSM-backed MPSC ring for MPP mesh inboxes.
//!
//! PG's `shm_mq` is hard-wired SPSC (asserted in `shm_mq_set_sender`), so one inbox
//! can't be shared across N-1 peers without forking PG. This ring is the replacement:
//! a fixed-size byte-message ring sitting in a `dsm_segment`, MPSC-correct via
//! Vyukov-style per-slot sequence counters.
//!
//! Layout (contiguous bytes, `repr(C)`):
//!
//! ```text
//! +- DsmMpscRingHeader -----------------------+
//! |  magic, version, ring_size, slot_capacity |
//! |  sender_count, detached, receiver_packed  |
//! |  (cache-line padding around head/tail)    |
//! |  head, tail (each on its own line)        |
//! +-------------------------------------------+
//! | Slot[0] | Slot[1] | ... | Slot[N-1]       |
//! +-------------------------------------------+
//!
//! Slot {
//!     seq:  AtomicU64,    // Vyukov phase counter
//!     len:  AtomicU32,
//!     data: [u8; slot_capacity - SLOT_HEADER_SIZE]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Slot phase encoding (Vyukov MPMC reduced to MPSC):
//!
//! ```text
//! slot[i] in round k:  seq = k * ring_size + i      // empty
//!                      seq = k * ring_size + i + 1  // ready
//! ```
//!
//! Producer claim at `tail = T`: read `slot[T % ring_size].seq`. `seq == T` then CAS
//! `tail: T → T+1`, winner copies payload and stores `seq = T + 1` (Release). `seq < T`
//! means ring full. `seq > T` means another producer took `T`, retry. Winner
//! `SetLatch`es the receiver.
//!
//! Consumer take at `head = H`: `slot[H % ring_size].seq == H + 1` means ready. Read
//! payload, store `seq = H + ring_size` (next round's empty marker), then `head = H+1`.
//! The single consumer owns `head` without CAS; producers contend only on `tail`.
//!
//! **Safety**: public methods on `DsmMpscSender` / `DsmMpscReceiver` are type-safe once
//! constructed. The constructors are `unsafe` because the DSM region must be correctly
//! sized and not aliased (one process calls `create_at`, everyone else `attach_at`).
//!
//! **Counter wraparound**: head/tail are `u64`, incremented by one per op. At 100M
//! ops/sec that's ~5800 years, so we ignore wrap. The seq math would break under wrap
//! (pre-wrap `seq` would exceed post-wrap `tail` and producers would spin forever); if
//! that ever matters, add a `tail < u64::MAX - margin` check and reset the ring.
