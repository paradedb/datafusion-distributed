//! In-process instantiation of the shared-memory transport, plus an end-to-end test.
//!
//! A real distributed query runs through [`ShmChannelResolver`] with no Postgres and no Flight.
//! This is the rebase-safety payoff: a single process plays every role that production splits
//! across the leader (build and slice the plan), Postgres (allocate the DSM region, launch the
//! workers), and each worker (run a producer fragment and push it through the mesh). If an upstream
//! change breaks the channel-protocol contract, the boundary routing API, or the ready-to-run
//! fragment contract, the test below fails here, before any downstream embedder rebuilds.
//!
//! Workers are passive executors: they run the ready-to-run per-task plans the coordinator
//! dispatches (task-specialized, nested stages `Remote`), whose boundary leaves read the mesh
//! through the session's [`ShmChannelResolver`]. Nothing on the worker re-plans, converts, or
//! dispatches. A [`DispatchPlanSource`] on the leader session captures each dispatched plan,
//! standing in for a production source that serializes it with the embedder's codec.
//!
//! What's faithful vs. simplified relative to the Postgres path:
//! - Faithful: the DSM ring mesh, the framing, the cooperative drain, `ShmWorkerChannel::execute_task`,
//!   the per-fragment routing (`collect_dispatched_stages`), `run_worker_fragment`, the leader
//!   consuming via `DistributedExec::execute`, and the dispatch handoff through
//!   `DispatchPlanSource`.
//! - Simplified: the dispatched subplans are captured as `Arc`s rather than serialized through
//!   the `SetPlan` frames the coordinator routes over the mesh (all roles live in one address
//!   space), the wakeup is a no-op (the cooperative consumer yields rather than parking), and
//!   there's no cancellation source.
