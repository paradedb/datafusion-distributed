/// Walks an [ExecutionPlan] and injects [NetworkShuffleExec], [NetworkBroadcastExec], and
/// [NetworkCoalesceExec] nodes wherever a stage boundary is needed. The returned plan has the
/// same shape as the input except for these inserted boundary nodes.
///
/// Per-node task counts are recorded in a side map on the [InjectNetworkBoundaryContext] (keyed by
/// plan-pointer identity) rather than mutated into the plan itself. Later passes look them up via
/// [InjectNetworkBoundaryContext::task_count].
///
/// # The three-phase loop
///
/// For every stage in the plan we run the same three phases. The bottom-up walk drives them:
/// it climbs the plan, and each time it discovers that the current node would need a network
/// boundary below itself, it pauses and runs phases 2 and 3 to "close" the stage that's just
/// been delimited, then resumes climbing into the next stage above.
///
/// ## Phase 1 — bottom-up walk, until a stage gets delimited
///
/// - Starting from the leaves, we climb the plan, asking the [TaskEstimator] for a task count
///   at each leaf and merging children's task counts at each inner node.
/// - We keep going until the current node is one that requires a network boundary **above it**
///   (e.g. currently a hash `RepartitionExec` (→ shuffle), a `BroadcastExec` (→ broadcast), or any
///   other node whose parent is `CoalescePartitionsExec` / `SortPreservingMergeExec` (→ coalesce).
/// - At that moment, that node and the subtree underneath it form the stage we've just delimited;
///   the boundary will be injected above it in Phase 3.
///
/// ```text

///                │

///
///   children's task counts merge on the way up → reconciled value = T.
/// ```
///
/// ## Phase 2 — top-down propagation through the stage we just delimited
///
/// - Starting from the input of the boundary we're about to inject, we do a top-down walk over the
///   just delimited stage.
/// - The `T` task count reconciled from phase 1 is assigned to every node in the stage during
///   this top-down walk.
/// - Leaves go through [TaskEstimator::scale_up_leaf_node] which is called using `T` as the
///   `task_count` argument. The default file-scan estimator wraps the leaf in a
///   [DistributedLeafExec] that holds one per-task variant for each of the `T` tasks; the
///   wrapper is transparent to network boundaries (it reports the same partition count as the
///   original) and is replaced by its per-task variant in the task spawner before serialisation.
/// - If the walk meets a network boundary that was already injected by an earlier iteration of this
///   loop, it does **not** descend into it — that subtree belongs to a previously-formed stage and
///   has already been finalised.
///
/// ```text

///   │      (DataSourceExec)       │    with the per-task variant before sending
///   └─────────────────────────────┘    to workers
/// ```
///
/// ## Phase 3 — inject the boundary and seed the next stage's starting task count
///
/// - Now we wrap the producer stage in the appropriate `Network*Exec` node and decide the task
///   count above the boundary — i.e. the starting task count for the next stage up.
/// - We compute a scale factor from the cardinality effects of the producer-stage nodes
///   and apply it as `ceil(T_producer × sf)`.
/// - That becomes the new node's recorded task count and feeds back into Phase 1 for the next stage.
///
/// ```text
///                       ▲
///                       │   bottom-up walk resumes;
