# Worker versioning

Workers expose a `GetWorkerInfo` gRPC endpoint that reports metadata about the
running worker, including a user-defined version string. This is useful during
rolling deployments: when workers running different code versions coexist in the
cluster, the coordinating context can route queries only to workers running
compatible code.

## Setting a version

Use the `Worker::with_version()` builder method to tag a worker with a version
string. The string is free-form — any identifier that makes sense for your
deployment workflow. Workers that don't call `with_version()` report an empty
string.

```rust
let worker = Worker::default().with_version("2.0.0");
```

To avoid forgetting to bump the version on each deploy, derive it from an
environment variable set by your infrastructure at runtime:

```rust
let worker = Worker::default()
    .with_version(std::env::var("COMMIT_HASH").unwrap_or_default());
```

## Querying a worker's version

From the coordinating context, use `grpc::DefaultChannelResolver` to get a cached
channel and `grpc::create_worker_client` to build a client, then call `get_worker_info`:

```rust
use datafusion_distributed::{grpc, GetWorkerInfoRequest};

let channel_resolver = grpc::DefaultChannelResolver::default();
let channel = channel_resolver.get_channel(&worker_url).await?;
let mut client = grpc::create_worker_client(channel);

let response = client.get_worker_info(GetWorkerInfoRequest {}).await?;
println!("version: {}", response.into_inner().version);
```

## Zero-downtime rolling deployments

During a rolling deployment, workers transition from version A to version B over
time. To avoid routing queries to workers running incompatible code, filter
workers by version before the planner sees them. The recommended pattern is:

1. **Background polling loop**: concurrently query **only workers whose version
   is still unknown**. Once a worker's version is resolved, it is never polled
   again. Clean up stale workers (e.g. disappeared from DNS). This can also
   happen within your discovery loop if that's more convenient.
2. **Version-aware `WorkerResolver`**: implement `get_urls()` to return only the
   compatible URLs from the resolved set.

```{note}
This example assumes a version change corresponds to a new IP address (e.g.
Kubernetes pods). If your infrastructure reuses IPs across deploys (e.g. EC2
instances restarting in place), invalidate cached entries when the underlying
process restarts.
```

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
use std::time::Duration;
use url::Url;
use datafusion::common::{HashMap, DataFusionError};
use datafusion_distributed::{grpc, GetWorkerInfoRequest, WorkerResolver};

struct VersionAwareWorkerResolver {
    compatible_urls: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Url>>>,
}

/// Polls only unresolved workers and caches their versions.
/// Workers that respond successfully are never polled again.
async fn background_version_resolver(
    all_worker_urls: Vec<Url>,
    local_version: String,
    compatible_urls: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Url>>>,
    channel_resolver: Arc<grpc::DefaultChannelResolver>,
) {
    let mut version_cache: HashMap<Url, String> = HashMap::new();

    loop {
        let new_worker_urls: Vec<_> = all_worker_urls
            .iter()
            .filter(|url| !version_cache.contains_key(*url))
            .collect();

        let version_checks = futures::future::join_all(new_worker_urls.iter().map(|url| {
            let cr = Arc::clone(&channel_resolver);
            async move {
                let channel = cr.get_channel(url).await.ok()?;
                let mut client = grpc::create_worker_client(channel);
                let resp = client.get_worker_info(GetWorkerInfoRequest {}).await.ok()?;
                Some(resp.into_inner().version)
            }
        }))
        .await;

        for (url, result) in new_worker_urls.iter().zip(version_checks) {
            if let Some(version) = result {
                version_cache.insert((*url).clone(), version);
            }
        }

        let matching_urls = all_worker_urls
            .iter()
            .filter(|url| version_cache.get(*url).is_some_and(|v| v == &local_version))
            .cloned()
            .collect();
        *compatible_urls.write().unwrap() = matching_urls;

        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
    }
}

impl VersionAwareWorkerResolver {
    fn start_version_filtering(
        all_worker_urls: Vec<Url>,
        expected_version: String,
        channel_resolver: Arc<grpc::DefaultChannelResolver>,
    ) -> Self {
        let compatible_urls = Arc::new(RwLock::new(vec![]));

        tokio::spawn(background_version_resolver(
            all_worker_urls,
            expected_version,
            compatible_urls.clone(),
            channel_resolver,
        ));

        Self { compatible_urls }
    }
}

impl WorkerResolver for VersionAwareWorkerResolver {
    fn get_urls(&self) -> Result<Vec<Url>, DataFusionError> {
        Ok(self.compatible_urls.read().unwrap().clone())
    }
}
```

With the resolver in place, wire it into the session and tag each worker with a
version:

```rust
use datafusion::execution::SessionStateBuilder;
use datafusion_distributed::{DistributedExt, Worker};

let worker_version = std::env::var("COMMIT_HASH").unwrap_or_default();

// `all_worker_urls` and `channel_resolver` come from your service discovery.
let resolver = VersionAwareWorkerResolver::start_version_filtering(
    all_worker_urls,
    worker_version.clone(),
    channel_resolver,
);

let state = SessionStateBuilder::new()
    .with_default_features()
    .with_distributed_worker_resolver(resolver)
    .with_distributed_planner()
    .build();

let ctx = SessionContext::from(state);

let worker = Worker::default().with_version(worker_version);

Server::builder()
    .add_service(worker.into_worker_server())
    .serve(addr)
    .await?;
```

The coordinating context's resolver concurrently polls only unresolved workers in
the background. Once a worker responds, its version is cached and not queried
again. Only workers whose version matches the expected version appear in
`get_urls()`.

This `VersionAwareWorkerResolver` is a `WorkerResolver` like any other — see
[Resolving workers](../user-guide/02-worker-resolver.md) for the trait's contract and the
synchronous `get_urls()` requirement.
