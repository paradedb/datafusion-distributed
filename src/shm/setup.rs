//! Mesh construction over a caller-supplied shared buffer, the extension point between an embedder's buffer
//! allocation and the transport.
//!
//! The embedder allocates the shared region (a PG `dsm_segment`, or a heap buffer in-process),
//! sizes it with [`dsm_region_bytes`], then calls [`leader_setup`] on the proc that initializes the
//! rings and [`worker_setup`] on each producer proc. Both hand back an [`MppMesh`] the embedder
//! installs on its DataFusion session; `worker_setup` also returns the outbound senders and the
//! plan bytes copied out of the region. [`run_worker_fragment`] is the producer push loop.
//!
//! The two platform primitives the embedder supplies are the [`Wakeup`] (how to wake a blocked
//! consumer) and the [`Interrupt`] (how to check for cancellation); everything here is otherwise
//! pure Rust over the shared buffer.
