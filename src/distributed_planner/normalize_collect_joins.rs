/// Rewrites joins that would otherwise be restricted to a single task into shapes that

///
/// [insert_broadcast_execs] can only broadcast the build side of joins whose join type never
/// emits build-side rows (see [is_left_broadcast_safe]): a broadcast build side is replicated
/// into every task, so a join type that emits build-side rows would emit them once per task.
/// Without a broadcast, a multi-task stage gives every task only a slice of the collected build
/// side, which silently loses rows. This pass rewrites the affected joins instead of leaving
/// them to run in a single task:
///
/// - CollectLeft [HashJoinExec]s with a build-side-emitting join type become
///   [PartitionMode::Partitioned], hash-repartitioning both sides on the join keys. Every
///   matching row pair then meets in exactly one partition, owned by exactly one task, so each
///   build-side row is emitted exactly once with complete match information.
/// - [NestedLoopJoinExec]s with a build-side-emitting join type are swapped (Left becomes
///   Right, LeftSemi becomes RightSemi, and so on), so the emitting side becomes the
///   partitioned probe side and the other side can be broadcast as usual. There is no
///   partitioned fallback for a NestedLoopJoin: its predicate is arbitrary, so no partitioning
///   can co-locate matching rows.
///
/// Two shapes have no distributed rewrite and are left untouched for
/// [inject_network_boundaries] to cap at a single task:
///
/// - Null-aware anti joins: their NULL-existence checks require global knowledge held in
///   process-local shared state, which cannot span tasks in any orientation.
/// - Full joins: they emit unmatched rows from both sides, so they need global match knowledge
///   on both sides at once.
