//! Deferred: `mod self_hosted` is gated out (`#[cfg(any())]`) in `shm/mod.rs`. This file still
//! targets the removed `WorkerTransport`/`WorkerDispatch` dispatch umbrella, which the
//! `ChannelResolver`/`WorkerChannel` protocol has no analog for. Its no-gRPC-default role is now
//! served by `InProcessChannelResolver`, and the in-crate ring safety net by the `in_process` test,
//! so it stays unported until reimplemented as a `ChannelResolver` driving produce over
//! `coordinator_channel`. Kept for reference; it does not compile against this branch.
//!
//! The shared-memory transport hosting its own workers, so it can serve as a session default.
//!
//! Production embedders drive the mesh themselves: they allocate the region, launch the worker
//! processes, and deliver plans out of band, so [`ShmMqWorkerTransport`]'s dispatcher is a no-op.
//! That shape cannot be a default transport: a default gets nothing but the `WorkerTransport`
//! calls. [`SelfHostedShmTransport`] closes that gap by playing the embedder itself, in-process:
//! dispatch delivers each task's plan through the worker session machinery
//! ([`Worker::set_task_plan`]: codec round-trip, work-unit feed channels, metrics back-channel)
//! and runs the producer fragments as tasks pushing through a heap-backed DSM mesh; `open` reads
//! the rings from the leader side. Every cross-stage byte moves through the same rings, framing,
//! and cooperative drain a production embedder uses.
//!
//! Per query, the harness lives from the first dispatch to the cancellation token firing (the
//! head stream dropping). The mesh is sized and built lazily at the first `open`, once every
//! stage has been dispatched and the routing is known.
