/// The producer's send end for one partition channel, symmetric to a [crate::WorkerConnection] read.
///
/// This lives in the shm module rather than the core transport surface: only a push-based transport
/// (the shared-memory mesh) produces through sinks. Flight produces inside its gRPC worker service
/// and the in-memory transport pulls straight from the local task registry, so neither needs it.
///
/// Contract with the produce loop:
/// - Batches arrive in `send` order and can be assumed non-empty.
/// - After a failed `send` the channel state is unspecified, but the caller still calls `finish` so
///   the consumer sees EOF; `finish` must tolerate a prior `send` error.
/// - Dropping a sink without calling `finish` does not end the channel, by design: `finish` is async
///   so Drop can't run it, and an implicit EOF would make an aborted producer look like a clean,
///   short stream. Abnormal teardown belongs to the transport, not the sink.
/// - `send` borrows the batch because transports serialize it into their own buffers; none needs
///   ownership.
