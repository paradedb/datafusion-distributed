//! Validates the fundamental invariant of stage replication: for every stage,
//! executing its plan once per task over the per-task input assignment and unioning the
//! outputs must be equivalent to executing it once over all the data.
//!
//! DataFusion's optimizer discharges each operator's `required_input_distribution()`
//! obligations *process-locally* (a `SinglePartition` requirement is satisfied by a
//! `CoalescePartitionsExec`, a `HashPartitioned` one by a `RepartitionExec`). Replicating the
//! plan across tasks silently reinterprets "all the data" as "this task's slice", invalidating
//! those discharged obligations. Only the exchange operators — the `Network*Exec` boundaries —
//! restore properties globally:
//!
//! - `NetworkShuffleExec` → globally hash-partitioned (equal keys co-locate cluster-wide)
//! - `NetworkBroadcastExec` → a complete, identical copy in every task
//! - `NetworkCoalesceExec` → a global single partition, via a single consumer task
//!
//! The validator classifies every stage-local subtree bottom-up as either [Replicated]
//! (every task materializes the identical complete dataset) or [Partitioned] (every task
//! materializes a task-specific slice whose union is the whole), and enforces two obligations
//! along the way:
//!
//! (A) every declared input-distribution requirement must hold *cluster-globally*:
//!     `SinglePartition` may only be satisfied by a replicated subtree, and
//!     `HashPartitioned` only by a claim that (1) semantically satisfies the required
//!     expressions — checked with [Partitioning::satisfaction] against the child's claimed
//!     output partitioning and equivalence classes, exactly as DataFusion's own
//!     EnforceDistribution/SanityCheckPlan do process-locally — and (2) is globally true,
//!     i.e. established by a global exchange rather than a stage-local repartition;
//! (B) replicated data may only feed operators that never *emit* rows driven by it —
//!     N task instances would emit such rows N times, and the machinery that deduplicates
//!     them in a single process (e.g. the hash join's shared visited bitmap) does not exist
//!     across tasks. This is the one fact not derivable from any DataFusion API; see
//!     [emits_rows_driven_by].
//!
//! Ordering is a known gap: output-ordering claims weaken from global to task-local exactly
//! like distribution claims, but this validator does not model them.
