/// Prepares the distributed plan for execution, which implies:
/// 1. Perform some worker URL assignation, choosing either:
///    - The URLs set by the user with [crate::TaskEstimator::route_tasks].
///    - Randomly otherwise
/// 2. Sending the sliced subplans to the assigned URLs. For each URL assigned to a task, a
///    network call feeding the subplan is necessary.
/// 3. In each network boundary, set the input plan to `None`. That way, network boundaries
///    become nodes without children and traversing them will not go further down in.
/// 4. Spawn a background task per worker that waits for the worker to finish and collects
///    its metrics into [DistributedExec::task_metrics] via the coordinator channel.
