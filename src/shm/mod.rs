//! Shared-memory transport.
//!
//! A non-gRPC [`ChannelResolver`] for co-located execution, where "workers" are tasks or
//! parallel processes sharing one machine and communicating over a shared-memory mesh rather
//! than gRPC. The transport-mechanism pieces (the MPSC ring, framing, routing, cooperative
//! drain) live here as a reusable library; an embedder supplies the two platform primitives via
//! small extension points: how to allocate the shared buffer, and how to wake a blocked consumer.
//!
//! The point of hosting it in this crate is testing: the in-process instantiation runs real
//! distributed queries through the transport in this crate's CI, so an upstream rebase that
//! breaks the channel-protocol contract fails here, before any downstream embedder rebuilds.
//!
//! [`ChannelResolver`]: crate::ChannelResolver
//!
//! Two assumptions an embedder signs up for:
//! - Execution is cooperative on a current-thread runtime: consumers spin on
//!   `try_pop` + `yield_now` and producers drain their own inbound while blocked, instead of
//!   parking on the `Wakeup` extension point. On a multi-thread runtime each stream burns a core while
//!   idle.
//! - Inbound frames demux into unbounded per-channel buffers, so a consumer that falls behind
//!   buffers the in-flight intermediate result in process memory. The rings in shared memory
//!   stay bounded; the overflow lives on the consumer's heap.
